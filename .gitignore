# Project specific
Auth_data/
# Keep the structure but maybe not the data if sensitive, but for now I'll assume Auth_data might have sensitive info? 
# The user mentioned "Auth_accouting_Data.yaml", let's check if it contains real credentials.
# The user asked to upload the project, usually they want the code.
# I'll exclude Auth_data/Auth_accouting_Data.yaml if it looks sensitive, but maybe I should just warn the user.
# For now, I will exclude it to be safe, or just exclude the yaml files in it.
